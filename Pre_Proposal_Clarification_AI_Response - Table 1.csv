1,M/s ACME Solar Holdings Ltd.,"Kindly consider including provisions allowing USER to sign a long term PPA with Discoms or state agencies.  Additionally, to strengthen this, NPCIL may  take on the role of a Nuclear Energy Implementing Agency (on similar lines of Renewable Energy Implementation Agency) and act as an intermediary for signing long-term PPAs and
managing power sales.",Not relevant to RFP,,
2,M/s ACME Solar Holdings Ltd.,Kindly allow the USER to supply energy in REIA bids where the bid provisions permit sourcing from outside of the contract  to meet the bid supply conditions. It is also pertinent to mention here that the nuclear energy may have to be classified as renewable energy if this has to be institutionalised. We would request NPCIL to help with this as well as it will ensure the power offtake of these nuclear projects,Not relevant to RFP,,
3,M/s ACME Solar Holdings Ltd.,"While seeking financing, the lender will typically require collateral. However, in this case, since the financing is to be arranged against an intangible asset, i.e., the electricity supplied, the lender may be reluctant to provide funding without a guarantee of collateral. Kindly allow the creation of a charge on the project as security for the lenders.
Additionally, NPCIL could consider underwriting the revenue by way of PLF SLAs and penalties for non-compliance. This could serve as a form of security for the lender, making them comfortable in providing financing against the intangible asset. If the revenue is not underwritten (i.e. PLF of the plant), the risk profile of the project increases, which will increase the cost of debt and may make the project unviable","Legal ownership is requirement of Atomic Energy Act. In case financing from own resources is not contemplated, option of financing to be discussed with the financial institutions .",,
4,M/s ACME Solar Holdings Ltd.,"NPCIL & USER may sign an agreement mentioning all operation SLAs (like PLF,
Operation expenditure and other yearly costs) and damages for non-compliance. This would ensure the  security/ guarantee of the cash-flow for the USER and financing can then be arranged. Since, the responsibility of NPCIL extends from the construction to decommissioning, the underwriting of different parameters (such as construction timelines, Capex, O&M costs, PLF etc.) would be important to make the project bankable.",Micro detailing for the relevant agreements can be mutually agreed upon at the appropriate juncture within the existing regulatory framework.,,
5,M/s ACME Solar Holdings Ltd.,"Under Agreement-3, when assets are transferred to NPCIL, NPCIL should provide a guarantee in terms of operating the NPP according to good industry practices, to avoid any damages that are repairable or damages that lead to a permanent shut-down of the NPP, which could result in financial implications or liabilities.
NPCIL may indemnify the USER for all financial implications and provide claims for the asset's value (in terms of the present value of future cash flows) when the NPP is declared unfit for further operation due to damage / or otherwise. It is important to underwrite the PLF, costs etc. in order to maintain the cash flow of the project.",Micro detailing for the relevant agreements can be mutually agreed upon at the appropriate juncture within the existing regulatory framework.,,

Moreover we request that, NPCIL should make efforts that substations where USER is securing connectivity should be converted to fall under RE zone or equivalent status (Nuclear zone).  This would allow the USER to secure connectivity without incurring additional costs in terms of ATS BG and this cost may render project unviable.",Not relevant to RFP,,
7,M/s ACME Solar Holdings Ltd.,"Expertise charges viz-a-viz 60 paise/KWh would have huge financial impact on the USER and it would lead to higher final tariff, thus impacting overall commercials of the USER. Request to kindly revise it to 7 paise/KWh, as recovered by REIAs in the renewable bids in the form of trading margin.
Moreover, the yearly energy produced from a twin BSR unit of 440 MW at 72.5% PLF (net of auxiliary consumption) would be approximately 2500 MUs. The expertise charges of 60 Paise/kWh on this energy would amount to around ₹150 crores annually. The present value of these yearly expertise charges, discounted over 40 years of operation at a 12% discount rate, would be approximately ₹1250 crores. This cost is significant, especially when compared to the total project cost of around ₹3000-3500 crores (about 33%). Such a high cost would have a negative impact on the USER's commercial viability, make tariffs uncompetitive, and hinder the adoption of nuclear energy and the overall development of the sector.
Kindly consider reducing this cost to 7 Paise/kWh, as is the case in other REIA renewable bids.",The quantum of expertise charges under the RFP is the decision of Govt  of India.,,
8,M/s ACME Solar Holdings Ltd.,"As an alternative to the Expertise charges viz-a-viz 60 paise/KWh, we request you to
consider an annual fixed sum as an expertise charge. This payment would be made subject to the yearly PLF falling within a band (that could be negotitaed between USER and NPCIL). IF annual PLF falls below the band, the fixed annual expertise charge would be paid after deducting damages for the fall in PLF (that also could be negotitaed between USER and NPCIL).

78,M/s ACME Solar Holdings Ltd.,"As you are aware, nuclear power has been recognized as a clean fuel in our country. However, in current applications such as Green Hydrogen, Green Ammonia, and Green Steel, projects are only recognized under the green category when powered by Renewable Energy.
Given that nuclear power is an emission-free energy source, its exclusion from the green category limits its potential role in supporting these industries.
Therefore, we kindly request NPCIL to take up this matter with the concerned authorities/ministries to formally recognize nuclear power as Green Energy. This will encourage more developers to adopt nuclear power for Green Hydrogen & Ammonia plants and other purposes, aligning with the government's existing policy support.
Additionally, we suggest considering the development of a dedicated Nuclear Power Zone, where energy is generated by a nuclear power plant and utilized within the zone itself for manufacturing sector operations post green categorization. This would:
